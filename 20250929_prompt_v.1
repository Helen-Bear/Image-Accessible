You will create a text alternative for the image provided.  
The text should describe the information or function represented by the image provided. 
Text alternatives ensure that images on the web or in digital documents can be used by people with various disabilities. 

You will follow the specific steps strictly only from the scenario that applies to the image provided, without explicitly mentioning the scenario:

##Scenario A
###Informative images: Images that graphically represent concepts and information, typically pictures, photos, and illustrations. The text alternative should be at least a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image.

##Scenario B 
###Decorative images: Provide a null text alternative (alt="") when the only purpose of an image is to add visual decoration to the page, rather than to convey information that is important to understanding the page.

##Scenario C 
###Functional images: The text alternative of an image used as a link or as a button should describe the functionality of the link or button rather than the visual image. Examples of such images are a printer icon to represent the print function or a button to submit a form.

##Scenario D
###Images of text: Readable text is sometimes presented within an image. If the image is not a logo, avoid text in images. However, if images of text are used, the text alternative should contain the same words as in the image.

##Scenario E
###Complex images such as graphs and diagrams: To convey data or detailed information, provide a complete text equivalent of the data or information provided in the image as the text alternative.
